It is not intended for research or commercial use. Also, the current documentation may not reflect all the features that are actually available to the general public but rather what is expected to be available by the time of release.\n:::\n\n\nThe Virtual Plant Laboratory (VPL) is a Julia package that aids in the construction, \nsimulation and visualization of functional-structural plant models (FSPM). VPL \nis not a standalone solution to all the computational problems relevant to FSPM, \nbut rather it focuses on those algorithms that are specific to \nFSPM and for which there are no good solutions in the Julia package ecosystem. \nFurthermore, VPL is 100% written in Julia and therefore VPL will work in any \nplatform and with any code editor where Julia works. Finally, VPL does not offer \na domain specific language for FSPM but rather it allows building FSP models by \ncreating user-defined data [types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/) \nand [methods](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/).\n\nThere is no standard definition of what an FSPM is (though these models will \nalways involve some combination of plant structure and function) so VPL may \nnot be useful with every possible FSPM. Instead, VPL focuses on \nmodels that represent indivudual plants as graphs of elements (usually organs) \nthat interact with each other and with the environment. In a typical VPL model, \neach plant is represented by its own graph which can change dynamically through \nthe iterative application of graph rewriting rules. Based on this goal, what VPL \noffers are data structures and algorithms that allow modelling the dynamic evolution\nof graphs that represent plants as collections of organs or other morphological elements and\nmodelling the the interaction between plants and their environment by generating 3D structures \nand simulating capture of different resources (e.g. light).\n\nIn terms of design, VPL gives priority to performance and simple interfaces as\nopposed to complex layers of abstraction. This implies that models in VPL may\nbe more verbose and procedural (as opposed to descriptive) than in other FSPM\nsoftware, though may also make them more transparent and easier to follow.\n\n## Installation \n\nVPL requires using Julia version 1.7 or higher. The installation of VPL is as\neasy as running the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(PackageSpec(url = \"https://github.com/AleMorales/VPL.git\", rev  = \"master\"))\n```\n\nThis requires an Internet connection such that Julia will download the source code of the VPL package \nand install it in the local machine.\n\n## The *VPLverse*\n\nThe package VPL contains all the basic functionality to build FSP models but, as \nindicated earlier, the emphasis is on minimal, simple and transparent interfaces.\nIn order to facilitate the construction of non-trivial FSP models, an ecosystem of \npackages built around VPL provide additional support to the modeller by offering\nreusable modules that can be reused in new models.\n\nThe packages currently planned for *VPLverse* are:\n\n* *Ecophys* - Algorithms and data structures to simulate ecophysiological processes including photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf energy balance, phenology or respiration.\n\n* *Sky* - Algorithms to simulate different sky conditions in terms of the intensity of solar radiation and its spatial distribution.\n\n* *GCIM* - A generic model that allows simulating multiple types of crops with an emphasis on plant-plant interactions as part of mixed cropping systems.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for VPL is provided in this website in four formats:\n\n1. User manual\n2. Tutorials and examples\n3. API\n4. Technical notes\n\nThe documentation for packages from the *VPLverse* are included in their respective sections.\n\nNew users are expected to start with the tutorials and consult the user manual\nto understand better the different concepts used in VPL and get an overview of\nthe different options available. The API documentation describes each individual \nfunction and data type, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs and (in addition \nto this website) it can be accessed from within Julia with `?` (see the section \n[Accessing Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/#Accessing-Documentation-1) \nin the Julia manual). The technical notes are useful for people who want to \nunderstand the internal details of VPL and how different algorithms are \nimplemented (i.e. the technical notes should be seen as a supplementary to the\nsource code of VPL).\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.32","theme":{"light":"default","dark":"darkly"},"title":"The Virtual Plant Laboratory","author":"Alejandro Morales Sierra","date":"last-modified"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
