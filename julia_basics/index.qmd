This section will include an introduction to Julia with special emphasis on what is needed to build models with VPL (i.e., a deeper understand of the language is needed compared to just doing data analysis or simulations).

Key ideas:

- Types and methods
- Mutability vs immutability
- Type redefinition and modules
